### Report:

Hello CEO,
My name is Erick Rodriguez, I am the Subject Matter Expert in Endpoint Detection and Response here at (bank name). I am writing this memo to offer guidance on the next steps following the latest IT outage experience worldwide as a result of a faulty content update pushed out by CrowdStrike last night.

As the SME here at (bank name) I want to emphasize the importance of using an EDR system. By offering enhanced visibility and rapid incident response capabilities, EDR helps our organization mitigate risks, investigate threats, and contain security breaches, thus safeguarding our network and devices from advanced cyber threats.

Although our company suffered from this company-wide outage, losses incurred are minuscule when compared to the potential losses from a cyberattack. The current cost of maintaining the CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor within our company as our form of EDR is approximately $184.99 per device annually which comes out to approximately $37,000 annually. Although losses incurred during the outage caused by the faulty software update are still unknown, the use of the CrowdStrike EDR platform has protected our company for the last 4 years ensuring that losses from cyberattacks did not occur. Potential savings from the use of the CrowdStrike EDR platform range in the millions of dollars as a typical cyberattack on a banking institution incurs an average loss of $1.6 million. 

CrowdStrike has time and time again proven to be the most efficient and trustworthy EDR platform with an average mean-time-to-detect of 4mins which is 6x faster than the leading EDR platform from Palo Alto and Microsoft and 11x faster than Sentinel One. With CrowdStrike, customers benefit from better protection, better performance, and immediate time-to-value delivered by the cloud-native CrowdStrike Falcon® platform. (CrowdStrike)

I also want to bring awareness to the fact that training costs for using an EDR system are very expensive as these tools are highly complex and require a large, dedicated team to be able to effectively use. If we were to decide to switch from the CrowdStrike EDR platform to a competitor, costs associated with switching would include both software costs and training costs for our staff who are already trained on using the Falcon EDR system.

As the SME of (bank) I recommend that we continue to use CrowdStrike EDR as the pros heavily outweigh the cons. I also recommend communications with CrowdStrike begin to gain insight into how this outage occurred and gain reassurance that an issue like this will not happen again. It is also in our best interest to document our losses and report them to CrowdStrike to negotiate a deal/ discount with them to make up for the losses we incurred.

If you have any additional questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out.

Thanks,

Erick Rodriguez
